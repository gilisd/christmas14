Christmas Exercise 2014

This project is a role playing exercise for Christmas 2014.

the idea is to switch FA and DEV and let them in a very short time construct this project. The FA is supposed to give
stories to the DEV.

Code:
- Start the application with mvn spring-boot:run
- web access: localhost:8080/christmas/getPresentsFor/*

This is a role playing game, developers get the developer doc, analists get the analist doc.
